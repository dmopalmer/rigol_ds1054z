Python Class for controlling the Rigol DS1054z Oscilloscope

There is no license for this work... it is use at your own risk (I assume no liability).

Based on [https://github.com/charkster/rigol_ds1054z]

This python class uses visa, which means that you will need to install: pyusb, pyvisa and pyvisa-py

See this article on setting these up and testing:
https://hackaday.com/2016/11/16/how-to-control-your-instruments-from-a-computer-its-easier-than-you-think/

If using linux and a raspberry pi, you will want to make the pi user a member of the usb group. This will allow
you to not need to run as root.

I wanted to control my Rigol DS1054z in python to automate my scope initization and data collection.
I am a hardware guy and my only formal training is a C++ class in college. My purpose in sharing the code
is to help others... if you find any bugs please let me know and I will upload the fix.

The two coolest parts of the code is (1) save a screen capture to a file and (2) easily collect waveform data.
You may also like how I can easily perform any measurement the scope offers, and specify units like s, ms, us and 
v, mv and uv. 

**Note: you will need to edit rigol_ds1054z.py to specify your specific scope device. See the hackaday webpage for how to do this.

**Note: when using "write_waveform_data" the first character in the data file is invalid, it needs to be manually stripped from the file. I could not find an easy way to remove it. If you find a way, please let me know.

Files:

rigol_ds1054z.py <- this is a class which will be imported by the high-level script

test_rigol.py    <- this is the high-level script that creates an instance of the class and calls functions

Here is the link to the official Rigol Programming Guide that I referenced:

I hope this helps at least one person.
